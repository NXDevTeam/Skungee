## Building
Open a command prompt

The following will clone Skungee to your current directory location. To change the current directory as to where you want it cloned, type `cd PATH` replace PATH with the directory path location.

Then type the clone command
`git clone https://github.com/TheLimeGlass/Skungee.git`

Now to build Skungee you simply need to run the `gradle build` command. You can find the compiled JAR file in `./build/libs` of the gradle folder when complete.

__Note:__ If you do not have [Gradle] installed then use ./gradlew for Unix systems or Git Bash and windows systems have executable gradlew.bat.
